A view is a primary mechanism for displaying data. The Hygieia dashboard offers a comprehensive overview through the following view methods:

- Widget View - Widget view showcases detailed information, which include features in the current sprint, code contribution activities, continuous integration activities, code analysis, security analysis, unit and functional test results, and deployment and environment status.
- Pipeline View - The pipeline view pulls back to show each component’s lifecycle progression through the development, testing, and deployment stages.
- Cloud View - The cloud view gives details about cloud resources and applications, including instance count, storage, and utilization details. 
- Product View - The product view displays each configured product's progression from code commit to deployment.
