## Overview  
Hygieia is a single, configurable, easy-to-use dashboard to visualize near real-time status of the entire delivery pipeline. The health of the continuous delivery pipeline, from code commit to production deployment, with all the necessary information around health and quality of the software, is essential for any DevOps Organization.
	

## Audience  
The Installation Plan provides installation and configuration procedures for every part of the Hygieia system. This document describes the correct order for installing the component/tier instances and performing basic configuration.

This guide is intended for a technical audience to implement and support the application. The audience should have knowledge of Java, MongoDB, Javascript, Git, and RESTful APIs.
