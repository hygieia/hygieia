Configure the Jenkins-Cucumber Collector to display and monitor information (related to code quality) on the Hygieia Dashboard, from Jenkins-Cucumber. Hygieia uses Spring Boot to package the collector as an executable JAR file with dependencies.

### Jenkins-Cucumber Setup

This section gives details about generating an output file from Cucumber (in .json file format), and then setting up the Jenkins job for the Jenkins-Cucumber collector to populate code quality information on the Hygieia Dashboard.

#### Jenkins Job with Cucumber

The Jenkins-Cucumber Collector uses JSON formatting output of [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io) test cases to provide dashboard results from various Jenkins jobs. This collector utilizes the tools standards established for the [Jenkins Cucumber Reports Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cucumber+Test+Result+Plugin). The common output files, generated by cucumber in the designated location, are used to populate the collector.

#### Test with Cucumber

The setup for utilizing this collector relies on the output of the Cucumber test cases. All languages that utilize Cucumber should allow setting the output format to JSON and setting the name of all output files to `cucumber.json`. Since cucumber tests can be written in many languages, there are many examples to enable the output format. Following are the examples for setting these options in Java and Ruby:

For Cucumber-JVM, the Cucumber Options should be similar to the following code snippet:
```java
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions( features = "src/test/features/com/sample",
    tags = { "~@wip", "@executeThis" }, monochrome = true,
    format = { "pretty", "html:target/cucumber", "json:target/cucumber.json" } )
public class RunCukeTest {

}
```

For Ruby-Cucumber, the Cucumber options for the `format` should be set to `json` and `out` should designate the correct filename (cucumber.json).

For example:
```bash
cucumber features/my_feature.feature --format json --out cucumber.json
```

After the output file,`cucumber.json` is generated during a test run, the Collector depends on a root directory to search for all output files included in the results. If multiple projects are being executed or multiple cucumber commands are being called, then the directory structure created provides the 'suite' names for the test result report. Following is an example folder structure:

```
root_dir/
|--- project1
|    |--- cucumber.json
|--- project2
|    |--- cucumber.json
|--- project3
|    |--- cucumber.json
...
...
```

#### Jenkins Setup

To set up the Jenkins job, ensure the correct directory structure is established, and then once the build is complete, archive your root directory. 
To archive your root directory, select the Post-build action as 'Archive the artifacts', and then set the files to archive them to the root of your directory tree.

### Setup Instructions

## Fork and Clone the Collector 

Fork and clone the Jenkins-Cucumber Collector from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Hygieia/hygieia-jenkins-cucumber-collector). 

To configure the Jenkins-Cucumber Collector, execute the following steps:

*   **Step 1: Change Directory**

Change the current working directory to the `hygieia-jenkins-cucumber-collector` directory of your Hygieia source code installation.

For example, in the Windows command prompt, run the following command:

```
cd C:\Users\[usernname]\hygieia-jenkins-cucumber-collector
```

*   **Step 2: Run Maven Build**

Run the maven build to package the collector into an executable JAR file:

```
 mvn install
```

The output file `[collector name].jar` is generated in the `hygieia-jenkins-cucumber-collector\target` folder.

Once the build is run, the code quality artefacts(for example, test.exec) should be available at the following path:

```bash
C:\path\to\junit\findbugs\pmd\checkstyle\jacoco artefacts
```

*   **Step 3: Set Parameters in Application Properties File**

Set the configurable parameters in the `application.properties` file to connect to the Dashboard MongoDB database instance, including properties required by the Jenkins-Cucumber Collector.

To configure parameters for the Jenkins-cucumber Collector, refer to the sample [application.properties](#sample-application-properties-file) file.

For information about sourcing the application properties file, refer to the [Spring Boot Documentation](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-application-property-files).

*   **Step 4: Deploy the Executable File**

To deploy the `[collector name].jar` file, change directory to `hygieia-jenkins-cucumber-collector\target`, and then execute the following from the command prompt:

```bash
java -jar [collector name].jar --spring.config.name=jenkins-cucumber --spring.config.location=[path to application.properties file]
```

### Sample Application Properties File

```properties

		# Database Name
		dbname=dashboarddb

		# Database HostName - default is localhost
		dbhost=localhost

		# Database Port - default is 27017
		dbport=9999

		# MongoDB replicaset
		dbreplicaset=[false if you are not using MongoDB replicaset]
		dbhostport=[host1:port1,host2:port2,host3:port3]

		# Database Username - default is blank
		dbusername=dashboarduser

		# Database Password - default is blank
		dbpassword=dbpassword

		#Collector schedule (required)
		jenkins-cucumber.cron=0 0/5 * * * *

		#Jenkins server (required) - Can provide multiple
		jenkins-cucumber.servers[0]=

		#Pattern to find cucumber reports
		jenkins-cucumber.cucumberJsonRegex=${JENKINS_CUCUMBER_JSON_FILENAME:-cucumber.json}

		#Another option: If using same username/password Jenkins auth - set username/apiKey to use HTTP Basic Auth (blank=no auth)
		jenkins-cucumber.username=
		jenkins-cucumber.apiKey=
```
