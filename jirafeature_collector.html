  Retrieves feature content data from the source system APIs and places it in a MongoDB for later retrieval and use by the DevOps Dashboard

This project uses Spring Boot to package the collector as an executable JAR with dependencies.

  </h2>

  <p>Execute the following command to package the collector into an executable JAR file.
  <pre code>
    mvn install</pre code>

 <p>Copy this file to your server and launch it using:<p>
<pre code>
  java -JAR jira-feature-collector.jar</pre code>

  <p>You will need to provide an <code>application.properties</code> file that contains information about how
to connect to the Dashboard MongoDB database instance, as well as properties the Hudson collector requires. See
the Spring Boot [documentation](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-application-property-files)
for information about sourcing this properties file.</p>

  # In Jira, general IssueType IDs are associated to various "issue"
  # attributes. However, there is one attribute which this collector's
  # queries rely on that change between different instantiations of Jira.
  # Please provide the name value reference to your instance's IssueType for
  # the lowest level of Issues (e.g., "user story") specific to your Jira
  # instance.  Note:  You can retrieve your instance's IssueType Name
  # listings via the following URI:
  # https://[your-jira-domain-name]/rest/api/2/issuetype/.  It is listed as
  # attribute "name" in the JSON response.
  feature.jiraIssueTypeId=Story
  # In Jira, your instance will have its own custom field created for "sprint" or "timebox" details,
  # which includes a list of information.  This field allows you to specify that data field for your
  # instance of Jira. Note: You can retrieve your instance's sprint data field name
  # via the following URI, and look for a package name <em>com.atlassian.greenhopper.service.sprint.Sprint</em>;
  # your custom field name describes the values in this field:
  # https://[your-jira-domain-name]/rest/api/2/issue/[some-issue-name]
  feature.jiraSprintDataFieldName=customfield_10007
  # In Jira, your instance will have its own custom field created for "super story" or "epic" back-end ID,
  # which includes a list of information.  This field allows you to specify that data field for your instance
  # of Jira.  Note:  You can retrieve your instance's epic ID field name via the following URI where your
  # queried user story issue has a super issue (e.g., epic) tied to it; your custom field name describes the
  # epic value you expect to see, and is the only field that does this for a given issue:
  # https://[your-jira-domain-name]/rest/api/2/issue/[some-issue-name]

  #Core Artifacts
  # These arrays of status mappings must be completed in order for custom source system statuses to be providable by
  # Hygieia.  Currently, Hygieia only maps to the following 3 status mappings:  to do, doing, and done.  You can find
  # all available issue status mappings by going to your instance's version of the following API call:
  # http://fake.jira.com/rest/api/2/status/.  Your statuses are listed in the JSON response as "name."
